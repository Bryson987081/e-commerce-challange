## What was the purpose?

The purpose of this challange was to build an app to help the user manage and modify a e-commerce site.

## How was it accomplished?

    -This was accomplished by addinng to provided starter code.  
    -First I created modles for category, product, product tags, and tags while adding refrennces as needed.
    -I created get, put, post, and delete methods for differnt routes including category, product, and tag.
    -Then I connected to the data base by using the command "psql -U postgres" and "\i db/schema.sql".
    -Then I seed the data using the command "npm run seed" and start the server using the command "nodemon".
    -Once the server is running I am able to test the code in Insomnia.
